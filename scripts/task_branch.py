"""Shared helpers for starting a task on a fresh `claude/<slug>` branch.

Used by two callers that start work the same way but trigger differently:
  - `scripts/hooks/branch-per-task.py` -- the UserPromptSubmit hook, automatic,
    fires only when sitting on `master` (the primary-checkout case).
  - `scripts/start-task.py` -- the explicit `/task` command, for worktrees where
    you are never on `master` and always sit on a stale (shipped/merged) branch.

Pure and stdlib-only so the hook can import it before the venv is active. Tested
in `scripts/hooks/tests/test_task_branch.py`.
